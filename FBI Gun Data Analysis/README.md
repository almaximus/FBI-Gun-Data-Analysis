## Analysis of applications for background check related to firearms from NICS

The project completed for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree contains the analysis of backgroun check applications data from National Instant Criminal Background Check 
System (NICS). The purpose of analysis was to determine if the number of applications had been increasing or not and under what conditions the number of applications
can be higher in one state than in another.

Note: the number of applications for background check doesn't reflect the actual number of guns bought however, this data is used to estimate the number of firearms
sold.
